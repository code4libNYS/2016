        <h2>Lodging</h2>
        <p class="lead">There are a few hotels and good AirBnB spots in the area. We are not designating a hotel or hotel block for this event, but are very happy to help with recommendations. Feel free to email Christina - see the <a href="#contact">Contact</a> information below.</p>
        <h2>Getting to/from Ithaca and Cornell</h2>
        <p class="lead">Ithaca is in a beautiful part of the state, served by a small airport, some bus lines, and a few state roads (if driving). We will be working on getting recommended routes and directions in this section over the course of the Spring. There are also recommended parking spots and a good city bus system to help you in getting around the city while you're here.</p>
        <h2>Food, Drink &amp; Entertainment</h2>
        <p class="lead">Ithaca has a great restaurant and nightlife scene. We will be working on getting some recommendations for you on the site in the near Spring.</p>
